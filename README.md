# Scalable-Machine-Learning-Assignment


# **Scalable Machine Learning with PySpark**

## **Overview**  
This project, part of the Scalable Machine Learning module in the Data Analytics program, involves working with PySpark to solve real-world data problems across multiple domains. The tasks include log mining and analysis, liability claim prediction, high-energy physics classification, and movie recommendation systems.  

## **Key Components**  

### **1. Log Mining and Analysis**  
- Analyzed web log data to identify request patterns from Germany, Canada, and Singapore.  
- Identified unique hosts, frequent requestors, and visualized traffic distributions.  
- Generated heatmaps to analyze visit trends.  

### **2. Liability Claim Prediction**  
- Processed and analyzed an imbalanced dataset of insurance claims.  
- Built predictive models using Poisson and Logistic regression with L1/L2 regularization.  
- Performed hyperparameter tuning and evaluated model performance.  

### **3. High-Energy Physics Classification**  
- Used ensemble methods to classify exotic particles.  
- Implemented pipelines and cross-validation for model tuning.  
- Compared different models based on performance on large-scale datasets.  

### **4. Movie Recommendation and Cluster Analysis**  
- Developed a movie recommendation system using ALS-based matrix factorization.  
- Conducted user clustering with K-means and analyzed top user groups.  
- Identified the most popular genres among highly rated movies.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **PySpark** (Data processing, ML pipelines)  
- **Machine Learning** (Regression, Classification, Recommendation Systems)  
- **Data Visualization** (Heatmaps, Clustering Analysis)
